💡 JavaScript Assignment 1 – Mastering Alerts  
This assignment covers the basics of using JavaScript alert messages. It includes simple tasks to understand how `alert()` works and how script placement in HTML affects behavior and execution order.

📝 About This Assignment  
This assignment helps develop a clear understanding of how JavaScript interacts with HTML through alert boxes. Each task demonstrates a different way to trigger alerts and explores how placement of the script tag influences output.

By completing this assignment, I learned to:

- Use `alert()` to display messages to the user.  
- Structure basic JavaScript in separate folders.  
- Understand script execution based on placement in HTML.  
- Organize tasks for readability and browser testing.

📁 Folder Overview  
🔹 01-basic-alerts/  
Contains basic `alert()` examples to introduce the concept.

🔹 02-sequence-alerts/  
Demonstrates how multiple alerts execute in sequence.

🔹 03-script-placement/  
Shows the effect of placing scripts in the `<head>` vs `<body>` section.

🚀 How to Use  
Open each `index.html` file in a web browser. The JavaScript code will run automatically, displaying alerts based on how each task is set up.
