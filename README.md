# 💡 JavaScript Assignment 1 – Mastering Alerts

Welcome! This assignment is all about understanding and experimenting with JavaScript alerts in a fun, structured way. Explore the folders to see how JavaScript behaves depending on how and where it's written.

## 📁 Folder Overview

### 🔹 `01-basic-alerts/`
Get started with the very basics. This folder contains simple `alert()` examples to warm you up.

### 🔹 `02-sequence-alerts/`
Here we play with the order of alerts! See how multiple alerts line up and how JavaScript executes them.

### 🔹 `03-script-placement/`
Ever wondered where to place your script tags? This folder demonstrates the difference between placing JavaScript in the `<head>` and `<body>` sections.

## 🚀 How to Use
Just open each `index.html` file in your browser and see the magic (or alerts) happen!
